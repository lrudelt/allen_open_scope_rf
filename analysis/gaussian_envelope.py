"""
Gaussian-envelope fits to Gabor-patch receptive fields, and the conversion
needed to compare their width against the Zebra (waven) pipeline's Gabor sigma.

Why this module exists
----------------------
The two pipelines report receptive-field *size* in incompatible ways:

* **Gabor patches** report no size at all — only a 9 x 9 map of z-scored
  responses on a 10-degree grid. A width has to be *fitted*.
* **Zebra (waven)** reports the sigma of whichever filter in the Gabor library
  correlated best. That is a real Gaussian sigma, but it is stored in a
  doubled convention (see `waven_sigma_deg` below).

`fit_gaussian_envelope` supplies the first, `waven_sigma_deg` fixes the second,
so that both sides end up as a plain Gaussian standard deviation in visual
degrees.

Resolution limit
----------------
The patch grid steps in 10 degrees and spans only +-40 degrees. A sigma much
below ~5 degrees is not resolvable — the fit is then interpolating between
grid points rather than measuring anything — and a unit whose centre lands on
the edge of the grid has a half-truncated map. Both are reported as flags, but
only the first disqualifies a fit; see `FitResult.usable`.
